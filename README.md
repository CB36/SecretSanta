Secret Santa match randomizer

This is a project I'm working to reinforce the Java I have learned in class. 
When finished, the program will create take in a list of people and their spouses.
Then it will pick someone from the list that IS NOT their spouse and assign that person as their secret santa. 

At this point all I have finished is the first part; a hashmap that matches each participant with their spouse. 
I am still researching how to randomize the values for each key and make sure each person doesn't get their spouse as the new random match.
